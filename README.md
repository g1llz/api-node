# Node ~ API
A simple boilerplate to start your new API :metal: 
It has JWT auth and a user registry using mySQL

how to use:<br/>
~ `npm install` to get dependences<br/>
~ copy and rename `.env.example` to `.env`, and put your configs ..<br/>
~ create a user in your DB (necessary to the get token)<br/>
~ finally, `npm run dev` to go!<br/>
